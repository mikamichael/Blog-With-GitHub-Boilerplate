excerpt: 信用证制裁条款译文及分析

---

- SHOULD THIS L/C BE RESTRICTED TO YOUR COUNTERS AND DOCUMENTS  BE PRESENTED VIA ANOTHER BANK OTHER THAN YOURSELF, WE WILL NOTE THIS AS A DISCREPANCY AND FOLLOW THE DISCREPANCY PROCESS.如果此信用证被限制在贵行柜台并且单据被通过非贵行的另一家以银行提交，我们将会将此批注为一个不符点并遵循不符点程序。（这里前面是一个倒装语句表现的条件语句，相当于IF THIS L/C SHOULD BE RESTRICTED ….)

- THE BANK MAY REFUSE TO MAKE PAYMENT AND/OR PERFORM ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS LETTER OF CREDIT SHOULD MAKING SUCH PAYMENT OR PERFORMING SUCH OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS LETTER OF CREDIT CONSTITUTE ANY BREACH OF ANTI-MONEY LAUDERING, COUNTER-TERRORISM FINANCING, OR ECONOMIC OR TRADE SANCTIONS LAWS OR REGULATIONS, BE THEY LOCAL, INTERNATIONAL OR VOLUNTARILY SUBSCRIBED TO BY THE BANK (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO UK TREASURY SANCTIONS (UKHMT),EURPEAN UNION SANCTIONS, UNITED STATES TREASURY SANCTIONS(OFAC), FRENCH MINISTRY OF ECONOMY FINANCE AND INDUSTRY  SANCTIONS (MINEFI) AND THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL SANCTIONS LIST (CHAPTER VII). 如果进行此类付款/履行此信用证项下此类义务构成对反洗钱、反恐融资、或经济或贸易制裁法律或规定的任何违反，不管这些法律或规定是当地的、国际的还是该银行自愿遵守的（包括但不限于英国财政部制裁(UKHMT)、欧盟制裁、美国财政部制裁（OFAC)、法国经济金融工业部制裁（MINEFI)和联合国安理会制裁名单（第七章），则该银行可以拒绝进行付款和/或履行其在本信用证项下的义务。（这里SHOULD MAKING SUCH PAYMENT OR PERFORMING SUCH OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS LETTER OF CREDIT CONSTITUTE ANY BREACH OF ANTI-MONEY LAUDERING, COUNTER-TERRORISM FINANCING, OR ECONOMIC OR TRADE SANCTIONS LAWS OR REGULATIONS仍然是倒装语序的条件句）。

- THE BANK SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF WHATSOEVER NATURE SUFFERED BY ANY PERSON ARISING FROM SUCH A REFUSAL OF  MAKING  PAYMENT OR PERFORMING ITS OBLIGAITONS UNDER THIS LETTER OF CREDIT. 该银行对于由于此类拒绝付款或履行本信用证项下其义务所造成的对任何人所遭受的任何性质的任何损失或损害都将不负责任。

- AUTHORITIES MAY REQUIRE THE DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION RELATED TO THIS LETTER OF CREDIT AND SUCH DISCLOSURE WILL NOT BE A BREACH OF ANY DUTY OF CONFIDENTIALITY OWED BY THE BANK TO ANY PARTY HEREUNDER.当局可能会要求对于与本信用证相关的信息予以披露，并且此类披露将不构成该银行对兹涉及的任何当事方所承担的保密义务的违反。
