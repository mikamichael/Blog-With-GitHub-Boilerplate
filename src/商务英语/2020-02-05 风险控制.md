excerpt: 商务英语之风险控制
---

** Do you wish to arrange for WPA and additional overage agaist Risk of Breakage?**

**你是项保水渍险和附加破损险吗？**

- Yes. WPA coverage is too narrow for a shipment of this nature, please extend the coverage to include Risk of
Breakage. 针对这种性质的货物只保水渍险是不够的，请加保附加破损险。

- Well, obviously I want All Risk cover. 显然，我是想保一切险。

- Please insure the shipment for RMB50,000 against WPA and Risk of Breakage. 请将这批货物投保水渍险和破损险共
50000人民币。

- No, I don't think that the WPA insurance covers more risks than the FPA, so we arrange for FPA. 我认为水渍险承保
的范围并不比平安险的范围宽，所以我们投保平安险。

** What's your reason for the refusal of payment?**

** 你们拒付的理由是什么？**

- We can't accept payment on deferred terms. 我们不能接受延期付款。

- Upon arrival, we found the goods were of poor quality. So we cannot pay for it. 货到后，我们发现货物的质量
较差。我们不能付款给你。

- We are sorry to inform you that the listed terms of payment do not correspond to customary practices, we can't
pay it. 很抱歉通知你，你所列的付款方式与通常的贸易做法不相符，我不能付款。

** Shall we take up the question of inspection today?**

** 今天咱们讨论商品检验问题吧？**

- Ok, the inspection should be completed within a month after the arrival of the goods. 好，商品检验工作到货后一个月
内完成。

- We suggest that the certificate should be issued by China Import and Export Commodity Inspection Bureau or by
any of its branches. 检验证书将由中国进出口商品检验局或其分支机构出具。

- The importer have the right to reinspect the goods after their arrival. 进口商在货到后有权复检商品。

** What is your specific tranport requirement?**

** 你们具体运输要求是什么？**

- We want to use FOB, in that case the risks and charges are to be passed over to the buyers once the cargo is
put on board the ship. 我们希望采购离岸价，这样货一上船货物的风险和费用都转给买方了。

- We need to book space for the shipment of 5,000 cases of fancy silks to Sydney. 我们需要订舱以便将5000箱的精美丝绸运往悉尼。

- We use ocean shipping, because tranport by sea is the most important mode of transportation in the world today.
我们用海运，因为海运是目前世界上最重要的一种运输方式。

- We would prefer to have goods carried by road and not by railway. 我们宁愿用公路运输而不用铁路。

- If you don't have direct vessel, we have to arrnage multimodal combined tranport by rail and sea. 如果没有直达
船，我们只好安排海陆联运。
